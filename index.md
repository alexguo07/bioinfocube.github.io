# ¡Hola, 2022!  ¡Adiós 2021!
## **Here is a sanctuary cube for a poor puppy who suffered from bioinfomatics lovesick syndrome.** 
## Please do not abuse the puppy or overfeed it!
### If the puppy chases after you and wags its tail, it means affection for you.
### Do not be afraid. You could play with it. It never bites or barks.
